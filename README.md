# Introduction 
DREAMS is an ambitious partnership to reduce HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. The goal of DREAMS is to help girls develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.

Girls and young women account for 74 percent of new HIV infections among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.

The 10 DREAMS countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) account for more than half of all the new HIV infections that occurred among adolescent girls and young women globally in 2015. This must change.

The DREAMS Layering tool is owned by MISAU (MOH of Mozambique).
